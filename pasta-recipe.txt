PASTA RECIPE.

Requirements:
• water
• large pot
• pasta
• salt
• tongs
• colander

Instructions:
1. Boil water in a large pot
To make sure pasta doesn’t stick together, use at least 4 quarts of water for every pound of noodles.
Salt the water with at least a tablespoon—more is fine
The salty water adds flavor to the pasta.
2. Add pasta
Pour pasta into boiling water. Don’t break the pasta; it will soften up within 30 seconds and fit into the pot.
3. Stir the pasta
As the pasta starts to cook, stir it well with the tongs so the noodles don’t stick to each other (or the pot).
4. Test the pasta by tasting it
Follow the cooking time on the package, but always taste pasta before draining to make sure the texture is right.
Pasta cooked properly should be al dente—a little chewy.
5. Drain the pasta
Drain cooked pasta well in a colander. If serving hot, add sauce right away;
if you’re making a pasta salad, run noodles under cold water to stop the cooking.
